a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. we import, analyze and visualize Human Resources data in Power BI. Building on your existing knowledge of the platform, you'll learn how to effectively work with Power BI using example data.


You’ll carry out exploratory data analysis and will use DAX to help build powerful visualizations. You’ll finish your analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.


We’ll finalize the case study by making design changes to our report that provides a clean, branded design.
